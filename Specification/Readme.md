## Objective
> Develop a lightweight AI-powered prototype that identifies phishing emails based on text analysis and metadata features.

## Task

1. **Research Overview**
   - Part of the documentation to be submitted at the end.
   
   - Define Phishing Detection Using AI:
     - What does the AI do?
     - 2 - 3 lines.
     - The role AI plays in combating email-based threats.

2. **Dataset Preparation**
   > Use a publicly available dataset of emails specifically.
   [Kaggle's phishing email dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset/data)
   - Preprocess the dataset to extract features such as:
     1. Subject lines
     2. Sender Information
     3. Email Content

3. **Model Development**
   > Implement a machine learning model:
   - e.g.
     1. Logistic Regression
     2. Random Forest
     3. Neural Network
   - Use this to classify the emails as phishing or legitimate.
   - Train the model on your dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Prototype Implementation**
   - Create a simple web-based interface where users can upload an email (text file) or paste email content. You can use any programming language you are comfortable with.
   - The prototype should output whether the email is phishing or legitimate along with a confidence score.

5. **AI Explainability**
   - Add a feature to the prototype to explain the AI's decision.
   - Highlight suspicious phrases or sender's metadata.

6. **Testing Scenarios**
   - Test the prototype using real-world phishing emails.
   - Ensure that no sensitive data is used.
   - Document cases where the prototype succeeded and failed.

7. **Documentation**
   - Include a 1-page explanation of the model selection process.
   - Provide UML diagrams for the system architecture and workflows.
   - Document potential limitations of the AI model and suggest improvements.

## Submission Requirements
1. **Code Base**
   - Submit the code with comments and instructions for running the prototype.
2. **AI Model**
   - Save and submit the trained model (if applicable).
3. **Testing Report**
   - Provide results from testing the prototype on different phishing and legitimate emails.
4. **Documentation**
   - UML diagrams for system design.
   - A summary of AI principles applied in phishing detection.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Model Performance**
   - Accuracy and effectiveness of the phishing detection system.
2. **Prototype Functionality**
   - Usability, clarity of output, and explainability of AI decisions.
3. **Documentation**
   - Clarity, completeness, and insightfulness of research and design documents.

The documentation for the project that you must compile counts for 50% of the marks for the project. The project demonstrations will then count the other 50% of the marks for the project. The demonstrations will be done either physical face-to-face hands-on demonstrations to the lecturers or using an online demonstration. Students should therefore ensure that their uploaded documentation includes a well-structured design of their solution (it must be in UML notation). The due date for the project assignment is 17 May 2025. No late submissions or extensions allowed.
