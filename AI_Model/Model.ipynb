ICT Results. \\\"Efforts to use computers to translate languages, known as machine translation, date from the 1950s, yet computers still cannot compete with human translators for the quality of the results. Machine translation works best for formal texts in specialised areas where vocabulary is unambiguous and sentence patterns are limited. Aircraft manufacturers, for example, have devised their own systems for quickly translating technical manuals into many languages.\\n  The EU has been active in promoting research in this field since the large Eurotra project of the 1980s. In common with other projects of the time, Eurotra used a 'rules-based' approach where the computer is taught the rules of syntax and applies them to translate a text from one language to another. This is also the basis of most commercial translation software. But since the early 1990s the new concept of 'statistical' translation has gained ground in the machine translation community, arising out of research into speech recognition. This dispenses with rules in favour of using statistical methods based on a text \\u2018corpus\\u2019. A corpus is a large body of written material, amounting to tens of millions of words, intended to be representative of a language. Parallel corpora contain the same material in two or more languages and the computer compares the corpora to learn how words and expressions in one language correspond to those in another.\\\"\\n[*]Try Metis II. \\\\\\\\n\\n\\n/-> back to headlines/\\n\\nFebruary 20, 2008: Man-made madness.

Humans create machines and, at some point, the machines develop artificial intelligence -- artificial only in the sense that it's technologically determined, not organic. Eventually, these pieces of wondrous technology turn upon their creators. But some robots (and we are yet to learn why), refuse to destroy those who made and exploit them. On the contrary, they want to help them demolish their mechanistic peers and restore order: that is, place those composed of flesh and water at the top of the pecking order. Movies such as Forbidden Planet, Blade Runner, I, Robot, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Lost in Space etc, all deal with similar themes. Ever since Mary Shelley's Dr Victor Frankenstein brought his creation to life, fiction has continued to explore the \\nambivalence we feel about technology. ...

M.I.T. researchers are harnessing computer models of human vision to improve image recognition software. By Larry Greenemeier. Scientific American News. \\\"Seeking the way forward, Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers are looking to advances in neuroscience for ways to improve artificial intelligence, and vice versa. The school's leading minds in both neural and computer sciences are pooling their research, mixing complex computational models of the brain with their work on image processing. This cross-disciplinary approach began to yield fruit a year ago, when a group of researchers led by Tomaso Poggio, a professor in M.I.T.'s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and an investigator at the school's McGovern Institute for Brain Research, used a brain-inspired computer model to interpret a series of photographs. ... Poggio says that understanding how it works could be a significan\\nt step toward knowing how the whole brain operates. 'Vision is just a proxy for intelligence,' he says. The human brain is much more aware of how it solves complex problems such as playing chess or solving algebra equations, which is why computer programmers have had so much success building machines that emulate this type of activity.\\\"\\n[*]Also see: Learning about brains from computers, and vice versa.

Others were aimed at improving the abilities of computers to perform tasks that our brains do with ease, such as making sense of complex visual images. But recently Poggio [the Eugene McDermott Professor in MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory] has found that the work has progressed so far, and the two tasks have begun to overlap to such a degree, that it's now time to combine the two lines of research. ...

Russ Juskalian's review of The Big Switch by Nicholas Carr. USAToday.com. \\\"A quiet revolution in computing is taking place as you read this. It'll change the way we work, socialize, and function as people, communities and nations. It will have an impact on how we make war and peace. Some say it's the biggest thing since electricity became a utility -- yet most of us won't see it coming. According to Nicholas Carr, author of The Big Switch and former executive editor of the Harvard Business Review, the revolution that's coming is based on the idea that the Internet, a network of computers, is becoming a gigantic computer itself. Not only will users be able to write programs to run on this 'World Wide Computer,' as Carr calls it, but sooner or later, this system will gain a level of artificial intelligence.\\\"\\n   /-> back to headlines/\\nFebruary 24, 2008: Comic books help students understand robotics theory - Prof creates materials using newer software. By Cindy Kranz. The Enquirer via Cincinnati.com. \\\"University of Cincinnati professor Ernie Hall has discovered the joys of using comic books in the classroom -- for learning -- although the professor of robotics and computer science isn't opposed to having fun either. Using a new software, Comic Book Creator, Hall has created comic books, finding them helpful in explaining technical points for college students in his robot control class. ... Hall started using Comic Book Creator when he entered Microsoft's Made in Express contest in 2006. The 12 finalists in that contest, including Hall, each had to do a computer blog. 'I was just trying to think, \\\"How can I make it interesting?\\\"' Apparently, it helped. Hall won the contest and a $10,000 award, which he gave to UC to support the robotics program. Students on the UC Robot Team also will use the software to cre\\nate a design report and presentation accompanying the team's International Ground Vehicle Competition on June 8 in Michigan. It will be Hall's 16th year at the competition. ... Team members also think the comic books will help young students connect with robotics. ... Hall, who has taught 25 years at UC, said he is constantly looking for new technology. 'It really is a way to communicate to the younger generation,' he said of the comic books. 'Since I'm getting older, it's something I need to work at all of the time. My students really understand video games. If I could capture the magic of video games and put that into education, gosh, I could beat MIT.

Wired. \\\"Can a machine think? That's the question that mathematician Alan Turing posed in 1950, when he posited his famous Turing Test. He argued that artificial intelligence could be thought of as intelligent if it passes a social test -- if it can fool a human into believing it's real. Alas, critics agree that no machine has passed the Turing Test. We're never fooled by chatbots for very long, as the annual Loebner Prize contest proves. The thing is, we humans are awfully good at decoding social cues and detecting humanness; we can instantly tell when a preprogrammed 'conversation tree' is repeating itself. That's why many philosophers say machines will never pass the Turing Test. Except, of course, for videogames. They're filled with AI characters -- enemies we confront, and teammates we play alongside. And the truth is, we often develop complex emotional and social relationships with \\nAI characters inside games. ... And here's the weird thing: In games, we know they're machines. We know our companions aren't human. But we don't care -- we still wind up treating them in oddly human ways. Videogames, in effect, are beyond Turing. As Simon Bart, a sociologist who studies videogames at Concordia University in Montreal, put it in a recent paper: 'The solo game is posthumanistically social.' It's about the pleasures of hanging out with machines even when you're aware they're merely machines.\\\"\\n[*]Also see: \\\\\\\\n\\n  [*]Future of video game industry taking shape at GDC.

By Mike Snider, USA Today (February 18, 2008). \\\"Today's cutting-edge video games have the look and sound of movies; some even have blockbuster budgets. But even game developers concede that their creations usually lack the emotional impact of a great film or book. Bridging that gap will be a key topic at the Game Developers Conference this week in San Francisco, a five-day gathering that attracts the industry's talent pool. ... 'I think the dog alone is the most incredible piece of artificial intelligence I have seen in a game. He really feels alive,' ['God-game' legend Peter] Molyneux says. The player gets his companion early on. 'It's a fantastic moment when the dog turns around to you and looks up at you and wags its tail. You can't help but feel good.' Molyneux expects that having a canine companion along the lines of Old Yeller or Lassie will help create an emotional pull. Up to this point, most video-game companions\\n -- almost exclusively human -- have simply followed the main character. 'Whenever you shoot, they shoot. It has been a very mechanical thing. You might as well have a floating gun,' says Jamil Moledina, executive director of the Game Developers Conference. 'The dog in Fable 2 is something that learns and behaves like a real dog.

By M. Mitchell Waldrop. Technology Review (March/April 2008). \\\"Much of modern life depends on forecasts: where the next hurricane will make landfall, how the stock market will react to falling home prices, who will win the next primary. While existing computer models predict many things fairly accurately, surprises still crop up, and we probably can't eliminate them. But Eric Horvitz, head of the Adaptive Systems and Interaction group at Microsoft Research, thinks we can at least minimize them, using a technique he calls 'surprise modeling.' Horvitz stresses that surprise modeling is not about building a technological crystal ball to predict what the stock market will do tomorrow, or what al-Qaeda might do next month. But, he says, 'We think we can apply these methodologies to look at the kinds \\nof things that have surprised us in the past and then model the kinds of things that may surprise us in the future.' ... Granted, says Horvitz, it's a far-out vision. But it's given rise to a real-world application: SmartPhlow, a traffic-forecasting\\ufffd service that Horvitz's group has been developing and testing at Microsoft since 2003. ... To monitor surprises effectively, says Horvitz, the machine has to have both knowledge--a good cognitive model of what humans find surprising--and foresight: some way to predict a surprising event in time for the user to do something about it. ...

ICT Results. \\\"Efforts to use computers to translate languages, known as machine translation, date from the 1950s, yet computers still cannot compete with human translators for the quality of the results. Machine translation works best for formal texts in specialised areas where vocabulary is unambiguous and sentence patterns are limited. Aircraft manufacturers, for example, have devised their own systems for quickly translating technical manuals into many languages.\\n  The EU has been active in promoting research in this field since the large Eurotra project of the 1980s. In common with other projects of the time, Eurotra used a 'rules-based' approach where the computer is taught the rules of syntax and applies them to translate a text from one language to another. This is also the basis of most commercial translation software. But since the early 1990s the new concept of 'statistical' translation has gained ground in the machine translation community, arising out of research into speech recognition. This dispenses with rules in favour of using statistical methods based on a text \\u2018corpus\\u2019. A corpus is a large body of written material, amounting to tens of millions of words, intended to be representative of a language. Parallel corpora contain the same material in two or more languages and the computer compares the corpora to learn how words and expressions in one language correspond to those in another.\\\"\\n[*]Try Metis II. \\\\\\\\n\\n\\n/-> back to headlines/\\n\\nFebruary 20, 2008: Man-made madness.

Humans create machines and, at some point, the machines develop artificial intelligence -- artificial only in the sense that it's technologically determined, not organic. Eventually, these pieces of wondrous technology turn upon their creators. But some robots (and we are yet to learn why), refuse to destroy those who made and exploit them. On the contrary, they want to help them demolish their mechanistic peers and restore order: that is, place those composed of flesh and water at the top of the pecking order. Movies such as Forbidden Planet, Blade Runner, I, Robot, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Lost in Space etc, all deal with similar themes.

Scientific American News. \\\"Seeking the way forward, Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers are looking to advances in neuroscience for ways to improve artificial intelligence, and vice versa. The school's leading minds in both neural and computer sciences are pooling their research, mixing complex computational models of the brain with their work on image processing. This cross-disciplinary approach began to yield fruit a year ago, when a group of researchers led by Tomaso Poggio, a professor in M.I.T.'s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and an investigator at the school's McGovern Institute for Brain Research, used a brain-inspired computer model to interpret a series of photographs. ... Poggio says that understanding how it works could be a significan\\nt step toward knowing how the whole brain operates. 'Vision is just a proxy for intelligence,' he says. The human brain is much more aware of how it solves complex problems such as playing chess or solving algebra equations, which is why computer programmers have had so much success building machines that emulate this type of activity.\\\"\\n[*]Also see: Learning about brains from computers, and vice versa.

By Kristina Peterson. Bay Area News Group via San Jose Mercury News / also available from Palo Alto Daily News (Robots head to highways and beyond). \\\"Modern driving is inefficient and dangerous, 'a waste of life, time and energy,' [Sebastian Thrun, director of Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory] said. In the future, autonomous cars powered by robotics could eliminate the United States' 40,000 annual deaths from car accidents and allow people to work or sleep in their cars, all the while reducing energy consumption, he predicted. ... Speaking with his frequent rival in robotics competitions, Carnegie Mellon robotics Professor Red Whittaker, Thrun capped the first public meeting of the Menlo Park-based Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence on Thursday by listing his goals for the new Stanford center opening next fall. It will be named the Volkswagen \\nAutomotive Innovation Lab, or more simply, CarLab. ...  The center, financed with a $5.75 million donation from Volkswagen, is scheduled to open in September. Whittaker said robots can also save lives in dangerous industries like mining. Robotics can also make agriculture more productive, he said.\\\"\\n   /-> back to headlines/\\nFebruary 25, 2008: Going Gunning With My Imaginary Friends. Commentary by Clive Thompson. Wired. \\\"Can a machine think? That's the question that mathematician Alan Turing posed in 1950, when he posited his famous Turing Test. He argued that artificial intelligence could be thought of as intelligent if it passes a social test -- if it can fool a human into believing it's real. Alas, critics agree that no machine has passed the Turing Test. We're never fooled by chatbots for very long, as the annual Loebner Prize contest proves. The thing is, we humans are awfully good at decoding social cues and detecting humanness; we can instantly tell when a preprogrammed 'conversation tree' is repeating itself. That's why many philosophers say machines will never pass the Turing Test. Except, of course, for videogames. They're filled with AI characters -- enemies we confront, and teammates we play alongside. And the truth is, we often develop complex emotional and social relationships with \\nAI characters inside games. ... And here's the weird thing: In games, we know they're machines. We know our companions aren't human. But we don't care -- we still wind up treating them in oddly human ways. Videogames, in effect, are beyond Turing. As Simon Bart, a sociologist who studies videogames at Concordia University in Montreal, put it in a recent paper: 'The solo game is posthumanistically social.' It's about the pleasures of hanging out with machines even when you're aware they're merely machines.\\\"\\n[*]Also see: \\\\\\\\n\\n  [*]Future of video game industry taking shape at GDC.

By Mike Snider, USA Today (February 18, 2008). \\\"Today's cutting-edge video games have the look and sound of movies; some even have blockbuster budgets. But even game developers concede that their creations usually lack the emotional impact of a great film or book. Bridging that gap will be a key topic at the Game Developers Conference this week in San Francisco, a five-day gathering that attracts the industry's talent pool. ... 'I think the dog alone is the most incredible piece of artificial intelligence I have seen in a game. He really feels alive,' ['God-game' legend Peter] Molyneux says. The player gets his companion early on. 'It's a fantastic moment when the dog turns around to you and looks up at you and wags its tail. You can't help but feel good.' Molyneux expects that having a canine companion along the lines of Old Yeller or Lassie will help create an emotional pull. Up to this point, most video-game companions\\n -- almost exclusively human -- have simply followed the main character. 'Whenever you shoot, they shoot. It has been a very mechanical thing. You might as well have a floating gun,' says Jamil Moledina, executive director of the Game Developers Conference. 'The dog in Fable 2 is something that learns and behaves like a real dog. It comes to you when you least expect it.

By M. Mitchell Waldrop. Technology Review (March/April 2008). \\\"Much of modern life depends on forecasts: where the next hurricane will make landfall, how the stock market will react to falling home prices, who will win the next primary. While existing computer models predict many things fairly accurately, surprises still crop up, and we probably can't eliminate them. But Eric Horvitz, head of the Adaptive Systems and Interaction group at Microsoft Research, thinks we can at least minimize them, using a technique he calls 'surprise modeling.' Horvitz stresses that surprise modeling is not about building a technological crystal ball to predict what the stock market will do tomorrow, or what al-Qaeda might do next month. But, he says, 'We think we can apply these methodologies to look at the kinds \\nof things that have surprised us in the past and then model the kinds of things that may surprise us in the future.' ... Granted, says Horvitz, it's a far-out vision. But it's given rise to a real-world application: SmartPhlow, a traffic-forecasting\\ufffd service that Horvitz's group has been developing and testing at Microsoft since 2003. ... To monitor surprises effectively, says Horvitz, the machine has to have both knowledge--a good cognitive model of what humans find surprising--and foresight: some way to predict a surprising event in time for the user to do something about it. ... Although none of the technologies involved in SmartPhlow is entirely new, notes Daphne Koller, a probabilistic-modeling and machine-learning expert at Stanford University, their combination and application are unusual.\\\"\\n   \\n     [*]Watch the accompanying video:  \\\"Eric Horvitz, head of the Adaptive Systems and Interaction group at Microsoft Research, talks about surprise modeling.\\\" \\\\\\\\n\\n     [*]Learn more  about SmartPhlow.\\\\\\\\n\\n   \\n  \\\\\\\\n\\n\\n/-> back to headlines/\\n  Though we have tried to provide you with links that will be active when you receive this ALERT, be advised that news articles have\\n a tendency to quickly relocate or disappear.
